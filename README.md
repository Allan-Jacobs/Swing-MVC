# Swing-MVC
An MVC framework for Swing.

This is a small framework to allow you to build multi screen
applications in swing just as easily as single screen apps.

### Adding the Dependency

This framework is in beta, and any help is appreciated.

Add the dependency to your `pom.xml`

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.redstoneblocks.java</groupId>
        <artifactId>Swing-MVC</artifactId>
        <version>0.0.3-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

After intstalling, go check out our [wiki](https://github.com/Allan-Jacobs/Swing-MVC/wiki) for tutorials.
