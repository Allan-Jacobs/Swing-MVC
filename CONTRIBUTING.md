# How to contribute to Swing-MVC

### Bugs

If you find a bug, create a new Github [issue](https://github.com/Allan-Jacobs/Swing-MVC/issues) for it. Please check for duplicates before doing so, however.
When creating an issue, be sure to have a clear **title** and **description** of the issue, and include a **code sample** if relevant. 


### Patches

If you create a patch to fix a bug, open a pull request (PR) and make sure to include the **issue**(s) in the PR description.
The code needs to follow the projects format, and has the needed **unit tests**.

### New features

If you want to add a new feature, or change one, first suggest your new feature as a Github issue with the `enhancement` label.
If you get enough positive feedback, create a PR with the a clear **title** and **description** for the changes.

### Questions

If you have questions, create an issue clearly describing your question.

Thanks!

Allan Jacobs.
